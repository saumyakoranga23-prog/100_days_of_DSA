Problem: Find Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists - Implement using linked list with dynamic memory allocation.

Input:
- First line: integer n
- Second line: n space-separated integers (first list)
- Third line: integer m
- Fourth line: m space-separated integers (second list)

Output:
- Print value of intersection node or 'No Intersection'

Example:
Input:
5
10 20 30 40 50
4
15 25 30 40 50

Output:
30

Explanation:
Calculate lengths, advance pointer in longer list, traverse both simultaneously. First common node is intersection.
